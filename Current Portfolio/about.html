								<h3>Where do you see yourself in 5 years time? </h3>
								<p>Focusing on excelling in my A Levels and creating a variety of projects to enhance my technical skills. Networking with my fellow peers and mentors involved in cybersecurity/software engineering to guide me during the degree apprenticeship application process and the follow through journey.</p>
								<p>During the 2025 summer break, I hope to participate in many hackathons to challenge my skills, take leadership and to build my current portfolio. Completing AWS and Google courses related to cloud and cybersecurity. Preparing my current skillset for my degree apprenticeship and polishing certain skills. </p>
								<p>During my degree apprenticeship, I will have gained hands on experience by working on real world projects from industry professionals. The start of building my home lab to explore and experiment with cybersecurity tools. Working on more complex projects to further enhance my portfolio.</p>

								<h4>What motivates you and when have you had to show resilience?</h4>
								<p>I obtain my motivation from the sense of accomplishment, frequently asking myself if the current journey I'm on is the right one for me to ensure that it aligns with my long term goals. however, the main source is the dream of celebrating that success with my family and displaying to them that their hard work and support wasn't wasted.</p>

								<p>But life isn't easy, such as having to adapt to a new environment for sixth form. The transition isn't easy for most, but by being proactive and reaching out my fellow peers and teachers, I built new relationships. Another challenge I overcame was from my results not reflecting my potential abilities, it had brought me down, however I rose up to the challenge by seeking support from my teachers and adjusting my study techniques.</p>
